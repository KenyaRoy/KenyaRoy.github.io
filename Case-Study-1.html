<pre class="r"><code>#Interested in understanding the distribution of IBUs and ABVs amongst beer styles, we thought to compare Budweiser’s beer style (lager) with IPAs and Ales. We found that IPAs represented beers with higher IBUs and ABVs and Lagers with lower IBUs and ABVs. Ales appeared to have lower values as well with more outliers with higher values.

#We know that Budweiser is one of the foremost beer brands in the U.S. and that Budweisers customers have depended on the company to provide a great lager option since 1876. We are also aware of Budweisers recent rollout of beverages that meet the needs of audiences interested in trending beverages such as seltzers and nonalcoholic beers. Like the Bud Light Seltzer and Bud Zero, Budweiser could stand to introduce an option for those looking for high ABV and IBU IPAs from a dependable, trusted brand.</code></pre>
