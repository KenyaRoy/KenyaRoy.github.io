#Thank you for pointing us in the right direction to use the Beers and Breweries datasets pulled from the company repository. We pulled these datasets into RStudio and conducted  an extensive exploratory data analysis for your review. We expect that Budweiser could benefit from gaining insight on our findings as you seek to get a greater understanding of the landscape of Breweries and Beer production in the US. For context, we looked at breweries and beers across the country by state and style with a specific focus on key beer characteristics including Alcohol By Volume and International Bitterness Unit.

#We determined that the missing IBU and ABV values were missing completely at random (MCAR) because we found that no other variable (State, Style, Ounces) impacted the probability of missingness. Using our domain knowledge, we learned that every style of beer has a range of IBU and ABV values. We determined that imputation would be the best method of addressing missing values as opposed to listwise deletion.In order to find the missing values in ABV and IBU, we calculated the mean of each variable by Style and imputed #them into BB dataframe.

#We found the median IBU for each state and plotted a bar chart for viewing. We found that DE and WV stood out from the rest. Both DE and WV have only two APA beers with high IBU values (which explain why their medians are higher) which skew the distribution. Median ABV are less varied than median international bitter unit values There doesn't appear to be much skewness in the IBU data. It has more of a uniform distribution with exception to two states (DE and WV).

#There isn't an apparent relationship. We don't have enough evidence to claim that there is a linear relationship between ABV and IBU in this dataset.There appears to be many beers with high ABV and low IBU values. If there were less of these values, the curve would be higher and would likely show a linear relationship in the scatterplot.

#We suspect specific styles are skewing this data.There are many styles of beer in this dataset, specifically 91 styles. It would be interesting to do a case study identifying which style(s) are skewing the distribution of ABV and IBU values.

#To test our hypothesis in the previous plot, we conducted a KNN test (external test with train and test sets split 70 and 30 percent) and compared it to the Naive Bayes test.

#We used both K-NN and Naïve Bayes models to get a better sense of the classification and accuracy. KNN gave a higher accuracy and sensitivity while Naïve Bayes gave a greater specificity. Using test and training sets of 70 and 30 percent produced the results in table 2. We see that Naïve Bayes produced more accurate classifications of Ales and IPAs and thus proved to be a better fit for this classification test.

#Interested in understanding the distribution of IBUs and ABVs amongst beer styles, we thought to compare Budweiser’s beer style (lager) with IPAs and Ales. We found that IPAs represented beers with higher IBUs and ABVs and Lagers with lower IBUs and ABVs. Ales appeared to have lower values as well with more outliers with higher values.

#We know that Budweiser is one of the foremost beer brands in the U.S. and that Budweisers customers have depended on the company to provide a great lager option since 1876. We are also aware of Budweisers recent rollout of beverages that meet the needs of audiences interested in trending beverages such as seltzers and nonalcoholic beers. Like the Bud Light Seltzer and Bud Zero, Budweiser could stand to introduce an option for those looking for high ABV and IBU IPAs from a dependable, trusted brand.
